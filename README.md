# Matomo CurrentLocalTimeWidget Plugin

## Description

This plugin displays the current local time so that it is visible when taking screenshots of the page. If the site time zone is different than the browser's time zone, the widget displays both times. The widget uses JavaScript to refresh the time every 60 seconds so that we're not making a server call or reloading the whole widget every minute.
