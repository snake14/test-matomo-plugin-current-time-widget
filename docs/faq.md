## FAQ

__Does this widget always show the site time?__

Yes, but when the browser's time zone is different than the site's time zone, the local time will be shown separately.

__What is the frequency at which the time refreshes?__

The time is updated every 60 seconds, since the accuracy is down to the minute.
